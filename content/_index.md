Hi! My name is <strong class='name'>Andrea Toaiari</strong>, I am a Ph.D. Student at the [University of Verona](https://www.univr.it/en/home) in the [Intelligo Lab](https://intelligolabs.net/), under the supervision of prof. [Marco Cristani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LbgTPRwAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my Bachelor's Degree (cum laude) in Computer Science and my Master's Degree (cum laude) in Computer Science and Engineering, both at the University of Verona. 


My research interests range from the broad field of machine learning and neural networks to the more specific fields of pose estimation, social signal processing and multi-task learning. In particular, I'm interested in Computer Vision automatic systems that can understand how people move in the space and how they interact with each other. As personal interests I cultivate a passion for [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90802614-andrea), [cinema](https://letterboxd.com/atoaiari/), [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/iu4xo078yzycunmskxxkxgvet) and videogames.
